                            <h1>Early Life (1955-1972)</h1>
                            <p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. His biological parents, Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, were university students and gave him up for adoption. 
                                <br>
                                He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, who raised him in Mountain View, part of California’s Silicon Valley. 
                                <br>
                                From a young age, Steve displayed a strong interest in electronics and mechanics, influenced by his father, who taught him how to work with his hands.
                                <br> 
                                He attended Homestead High School, where he met Steve Wozniak, who would later co-found Apple with him.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Jobs was a curious and independent child. He often explored new interests, such as electronics, and frequently visited Hewlett-Packard (HP) headquarters, which sparked his growing fascination with technology. 
                                <br>
                                While in high school, Jobs worked a summer job at HP, where he met key figures in the computing world. 
                                <br>
                                However, academically, Jobs was a rebellious student and dropped out of Reed College after only one semester in 1972.
                                <br>
                                 Though he officially left, he continued to audit classes, particularly a calligraphy course, which would later influence his design philosophy at Apple.

                            <h1>Teenage Years and Early Adulthood (1972-1976)</h1>
                            <p>
                                After leaving college, Jobs embarked on a period of exploration. 
                                <br>
                                He moved to Oregon, where he spent time at a hippie commune and experimented with Eastern spirituality and psychedelic drugs. 
                                <br>
                                This phase of self-discovery played a significant role in shaping his later beliefs about life, design, and technology.
                                <br>
                                 In 1974, Jobs took a trip to India seeking spiritual enlightenment, an experience that profoundly affected his worldview.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 In 1975, Jobs returned to California and joined the Homebrew Computer Club, a community of electronics enthusiasts. 
                                 <br>
                                 This is where his partnership with Steve Wozniak flourished.
                                 <br>
                                  Wozniak was a technical genius, and Jobs saw the commercial potential of his innovations. 
                                  <br>
                                  In 1976, they co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. in Jobs’s garage. 
                                  <br>
                                  Their first product, the Apple I, was a success among hobbyists, but it was the Apple II that revolutionized personal computing. 
                                  <br>
                                  Released in 1977, the Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers, establishing Apple as a leader in the industry.

                            <h1>Adult Life and Major Achievements (1976-2011)</h1>
                            <p>In his adult years, Steve Jobs's legacy as a visionary leader solidified through his work at Apple, NeXT, and Pixar.
                                <br>
                                After being forced out of Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT, a company focused on developing high-end computers for education and business.
                                <br> 
                                Although NeXT wasn't a commercial success, its technology played a crucial role in shaping future innovations.
                                <br> 
                                Simultaneously, Jobs acquired Pixar, which became a leader in computer animation, producing blockbuster films like Toy Story and revolutionizing the film industry.
                                <br> 
                                Pixar's success led to its acquisition by Disney, making Jobs the largest individual shareholder.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, rescuing the company from financial ruin.
                                <br> 
                                As CEO, he streamlined operations and launched iconic products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.
                                <br>
                                These products redefined industries and made Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world.
                                <br>
                                Jobs's relentless focus on design, user experience, and innovation became the hallmark of Apple's success.
                                <br>
                                Despite his battle with pancreatic cancer, Jobs continued to lead the company until shortly before his death in 2011.
                                <br>
                                His impact on technology, design, and media continues to resonate globally.

                <p class="think__description">
                    Steve Jobs' daily life and management philosophy offer valuable insights into essential values and goals.
                    <br>
                    Firstly, passion and focus are critical.
                    <br>
                    Jobs was deeply passionate about his work and dedicated countless hours to pursuing perfection.
                    <br>
                    His attention to detail and relentless drive for innovation resulted in groundbreaking products.
                    <br>
                    This level of passion and focus is crucial for success in any field.
                    <br>
                    Embracing Jobs' approach means maintaining unwavering commitment and self-discipline as you work towards your own goals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secondly, embracing creativity and challenging the status quo is fundamental.
                    <br>
                    Jobs consistently pushed boundaries and encouraged thinking outside conventional norms.
                    <br>
                    He believed in creating products that were not only functional but also beautifully designed and user-friendly.
                    <br>
                    This mindset fosters a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
                    <br>
                    Adopting a similar approach means valuing creativity, questioning existing practices, and striving to make meaningful changes in whatever you pursue.
